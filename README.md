# DSA_Project
Project for Data Structures and Algorithms module
 The aim of this project is to implement the four square cipher.
 
" You are required to develop a Java application that is capable of encrypting and decrypting a
text file or URL using a four-square cipher. The four-square cipher was invented by the French
cryptographer Felix Delastelle (1840-1902) and uses four 5x5 matrices arranged in a square to
encrypt pairs of characters in a message. Each of the 5x5 matrices contains 25 letters (the
relatively rare letter j is merged with the letter i). The upper-left and lower-right quadrants
(shown in green) are plaintext squares containing a standard alphabet. The upper-right and
lower-left quadrants (shown in blue) are the ciphertext squares contain a mixed random
alphabetic sequence. The four-square cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher that uses the
same keyword to encrypt plain-text and decrypt cipher-text, i.e. the key is symmetrical"
